## Cron job in Ubuntu to run this every day at 1am

To get the path for node`
`
$ which node
/usr/bin/node
`

Edit the crontab
`
$ crontab -e # this might ask you to choose an editor if you're using this for the first time
`

Add a new entry as so
`
0 1 * * * /usr/bin/node <PATH_TO_index.js_FILE>
`

For every 6 hours?
`
0 0,6,12,18 * * * /usr/bin/node <PATH_TO_index.js_FILE>
`
Save the file. You're good to go.
